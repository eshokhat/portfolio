# Ephraim Shochat – Data Analytics Portfolio 

Welcome. 

This portfolio highlights projects that show how I work with data: turning raw information into clear insights and actionable outcomes. 

My background comes from working directly with customers and operational processes, which shaped my focus on building practical, data-driven solutions that connect real business context with technical analysis.

## Tools & Technologies  
I work primarily with:  
- **Excel / Power BI / SQL / Python** – data analysis, modeling, and visualization  
- **HTML / CSS** – structure and styling of this site  
- **Git / GitHub Pages** – version control and deployment  

Each project was built from real analytical logic: defining the business question, building the dataset, structuring KPIs, and designing a clear narrative through visuals.

A **two-page Looker Studio dashboard** visualizing Israeli bank savings-plan data.  
Processed **51,975 official records** into **1,134 analytical observations** using Python (pandas).  
Reveals **rate differences across banks, plan types, and age groups**, identifies **negative-yield programs** (e.g., Yahav −5.5%), and confirms **market rate stability within ±0.1%**.


### **Business Scenario Calculator**

A **Google Sheets–based financial model** simulating Base, Optimistic, and Pessimistic scenarios with monthly granularity.  
Automates **revenue, OPEX, and tax flows** via live XLOOKUP aggregation into a summary dashboard.  
Visualizes **scenario outcomes** with comparative charts for Revenue, OPEX, and Net Income.

### **Customer Support Insights Dashboard**  

A full Excel dashboard built from a Python-generated synthetic dataset.  
It tracks support volume, escalation rates, and resolution trends over a simulated year — built to showcase the workflow from raw data to actionable insight.  
This project highlights **KPI design, pivot modeling, and dashboard visualization** in Excel.

### **Loan Repayment Comparison Tool**  

An interactive loan amortization tool built with Streamlit, Plotly, and Pandas.  
The app allows users to compare annuity vs. linear repayment schedules, experiment with loan parameters, and instantly see how total payments and interest evolve over time. 
This project demonstrates skills in financial modeling, dynamic data pipelines, and intuitive visualization, aimed at making complex financial decisions clearer.  

### **Aliyah Trends Dashboard (2015–2023)**

## Notes
All datasets are synthetic or public, created solely for analytical demonstration.
This portfolio reflects my focus on clarity, structure, and practical storytelling — using data not just to measure, but to explain.
